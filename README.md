# Calibration Software for City-Scale Microscopic Traffic Simulation

This software leverages IoT data streams for near-real-time calibration of city-scale microscopic traffic simulation models. It provides a framework for adjusting simulation parameters based on real-time data, improving the accuracy and realism of traffic simulations.

## Installation

To install and run the calibration software, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calibration-software.git


2. Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install them:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To use the calibration software, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the IoT data streams as input. The software supports [provide details of supported IoT data formats and sources].

2. Configure the software by modifying the `config.yml` file to specify the simulation parameters and calibration settings.

3. Run the software using the following command:


4. Monitor the calibration process as it adjusts the simulation parameters based on the real-time data streams.

5. The calibrated simulation parameters and performance metrics will be outputted and can be used for further analysis or visualization.
